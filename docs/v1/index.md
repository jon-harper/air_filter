## Bill of Materials

The filter can be printed with either one or two fans. The second fan can be used to provide additional airflow or act as a controlled chamber exhaust fan.

A method of mounting the filter to 2020 extrusions is coming soon.

## Assembly

Print SUAFT with ASA, ABS, or PETG. If your enclosure regularly reaches 60C, ASA is recommended.
