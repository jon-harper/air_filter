SUAFT is a combination activated carbon and HEPA filter for 3D printing. It uses 75x30mm radial fans to draw air first through a wall of activated carbon pellets and then through a HEPA filter.

The filter can be printed with either one or two fans. The second fan can be used to provide additional airflow or act as a controlled chamber exhaust fan.

A method of mounting the filter to 2020 extrusions is coming soon.
