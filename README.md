# Unnamed 3D Printer Air Filter

3D printer air filtration with HEPA and activated carbon; documentation coming soon.

## Overview

This is a combination activated carbon and HEPA filter for 3D printing. It uses 75x30mm fans (either one or two) to draw air through a wall of activated carbon pellets and then through a HEPA filter.

The filter can be printed with one fan for filtration only, or with a second fan to provide chamber exhaust or additional airflow.

A method of mounting the filter to 2020 extrusions is coming soon.
